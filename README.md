# Mindful Hacks Simple Web Game Submission

A simple web game coded with HTML, CSS and JS with no add-ons for the Mindful Hacks event.

This game navigates the player's interactions with his 3 friends, Adi, Hilman and Patrick.
We hope that through the use of the diary and the messenger as a medium, one can better understand the harms that the digital world poses towards our mental health
