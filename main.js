        <br /><br />
        How should I start this? Hilman has been telling me that I should start keeping diary entries to help me “reflect” on myself and things 
        around me. He says it helps him note down key events and moments to which he can look back on. I guess I’ll keep a record of important 
        events just in case I forget. New year, new me?
        <br /><br />
        This new year feels kind of surreal. Time has passed in a flash...Seems about the right time to start thinking about adulthood as well - 
        what is independance, what is the significance of friendships going forward...
        <br /><br />
        Too many thoughts to fit in one entry
        <br /><br />
        Best regards? Bryan.`

        <br /><br />
        It’s official. I’ve stepped into my new JC. Dang this feels weird but… I’m finally a JC student and honestly - the sight of those three 
        idiots in uniform really makes my heart feel fuzzy. Urgh I hate it when I feel like that but - The. Gang. Is. Back. For that, I am always 
        grateful.  Hopefully we’ll be in the same class too. 
        <br /><br />
        Fun nugget! Patrick was so certain about making it here, that he bought the school uniform before the year even started. Spoil market… 
        But I mean, of course he was going to get in, his O’s were straight As. This man’s always after excellence and perfection.
        <br /><br />
        On a side note, I gave Hilman a peek at my diary and he commented that it was very “bland”, and said that my entries should be more flavourful and exciting. Why do diaries have to be exciting anyway? I say his face is the one that looks bland. I kinda like that insult… I’ll use it next time I see him. Anyway, Adi did suggest I should add pictures. Feeling lazy...
        <br /><br />
        Best Regards? 
        <br /><br />
        P.S. I still don’t know how to end a diary entry haha`

        <br /><br />
        It’s been a while… JC has been a rush - choir rehearsals, a crap load of homework and all this new “social dynamics” I need to watch out for. Anyway, something interesting happened today. Our class went out for a bonding sesh and I noticed Patrick and Marianne sticking together a little bit too much? He even seemed to get a bit down when this popular guy Ethan started chatting with her.
        <br /><br />
        I’m sure Patrick likes her… even I would. He started smiling so much and dodged all the questions that Adi was asking him. The WHOLE train ride back home, he was just talking about her. I’ve never seen him so happy before.
        <br /><br />
        I don’t really know whether I should feel sad or happy. I’m not comfortable talking to girls, especially when most of them aren’t suited to my style. Maybe Patrick will be the first to go and then Adi and Hilman… Haha I’ll lose all my friends. 
        <br /><br />
        Patrick’s JC goals are questionable…

        <br /><br />
        THE CHOIR DID IT!! OUR FIRST JC PERFORMANCE IN THE CHOIR! At the SYF no less! Patrick and I had so much fun! Adi and Hilman were watching and they enjoyed the performance so much! Even Hilman, who is a music genius, only had good things to say! A FIRST FOR HILMAN! HAHAHAHAHA Adi was really impressed by the harmony of the costumes and set. I am so glad it all went well.
        <br /><br />
        Honestly, it was pretty nerve-wrecking, but hey we made it. Patrick has been so jittery about this performance for weeks. It was so funny to see him talk about it everyday. DAMN that guy can talk and talk. He even mentioned how his parents would be watching and he was so excited to show them what the choir had been working on. 
        <br /><br />
        I hope I can keep this energy and happiness up all the way till the end of the year. Hilman, being his cynical self, did say that we have to start focussing on studying soon though. Well, this was a fun energy boost should last a while

        `Dear Diary,
        <br /><br />
        The school’s National Day ceremony is less than two weeks away and per annual tradition, the Choir will be performing a piece for it. HOWEVER, we are still fumbling some parts! So far removed we are from the glory days we experienced  during SYF. Why didn’t we just do the same piece again one may ask. I call it the classic case of complacency. Many of us were in our own heads being drunk on the success that we have experienced and felt that we could do anything. Arranging, rehearsing and polishing an entirely new song within a month and a half was definitely not a good idea. Patrick seems to be almost on the verge of breaking down. He’s never been an especially quick learner, and I’m sure the reduced runway isn’t helping either. But we all know that he’ll put in the extra effort to make it work, so he’ll be fine. 
        <br /><br />
        Adi will also be going to the UK for the next two weeks to compete in some high level chess competition, best of luck to him.`

        `Dear Diary,
        <br /><br />
        Dang was it a hectic day. I don’t think I’ll ever get used to the early and long hours of performance days no matter how many times I do it. Waking up at 5 to be in school by 5.30 for final rehearsals, followed by almost an hour for costumes and makeup?! That’s almost inhumane. Even so, I’m grateful that it was about as smooth as it could go, with no major hiccups less a missing set of makeup. (which only served further slow down the process) 
        <br /><br />
        The performance, however, was about as bad as one could make it out to be, of no (almost) fault of our own. Even after the tech run in the morning, the sound systems decided to fail us in the middle of the performance, which threw us into arrays of confusion. Never have we ever even been briefed about how to react to a sudden failure of the mics. Some of us started looking around while others attempted to sing louder. Disaster. Fortunately for us, our teacher was among the audience and managed to settle us down with his familiar gestures, directing us to perform as per practice. 
        <br /><br />
        In the aftermath, there was crying, ranting and raging. Patrick in particular, was beside himself as he went on and on about the amount of time he spent to perfect his role for it to be foiled by the sound system of all things. I, on the other hand, was just glad that the fiasco was over and tried to get Patrick onto the same train of thought. Adi and Hilman got a good laugh out of this less than ideal scenario, and they thoroughly enjoyed themselves watching the performance and we poked some at Patrick as well. Bad choice? Maybe. But at least we got him to smile and laugh it off.

        Never again.`

        <br /><br />
        Day after day staying behind in school with Adi, Hilman and Patrick and sometimes Marianne may seem like the most boring thing to ever do, but it’s wild the kind of things you discover through studying with others. Adi has somehow gotten messier over the years, especially with his ever growing collection of highlighters for various colour coding. (he’s gotten another 6 shades since mid-years) Hilman is doing his thing, being good with all the theoretical concepts, but struggling with picturing flow for practical based questions. Patrick on the other hand, is almost always flustered, burying his head in the books, trying to master every aspect of every subject. I sometimes wonder how he manages to stay sane with the sheer number of hours he puts into studying. 
        <br /><br />
        JC is a crazy world, and there’s still so much more ahead of us. I personally don’t quite like studying, and it hurts my head to even think about the entire pile that has to be gone through to be adequately ready for exams. I’ve since learnt over the years to focus on the short term goals to feel more tangible progress in this trudge towards competency, but it is hard sometimes. Wonder what uni will be like..

        `Dear Diary,
        <br /><br />
        WE’VE MADE IT!! Our last exam is finally completed!! Wow, it has been a long, painful journey. I’m so, so happy to finally be done with it. Long break ahead!! I think that last H2 Math paper went as well as I could have expected it to. Not ideal, but I did my best. 
        <br /><br />
        The rest seem pretty relieved that exams have ended too. Both Adi and Hilman have not hesitated to engage in their hobbies right away, since their exams ended yesterday. Hmm maybe I should have followed them and taken H1 math too. Adi has been training “hard” for his upcoming chess competition. HAHAHA it doesn’t seem hard at all for him and he seems to enjoy himself. Plus, he is really, really good at it. 
        <br /><br />
        Hilman has been producing Da Vinci-level art. Damn those art pieces truly are a sight to behold. That guy is just too talented already, too much skill. Honestly, I would have just been playing games and rotting.
        <br /><br />
        Anyway, the three of us went out today to the movies. It’s been awhile since I watched a movie in the cinema and truly experienced the sounds and visual effects. I’ve missed having time to go out and enjoy myself like this. We watched Avengers: Infinity War. It was epic! It was so cool to see all the pieces of the MCU come together. I can’t wait for part 2 of the movie!
        <br /><br />
        We had a good time discussing the movie and possible plots and subplots for part 2 over drinks. Adi went full-nerd on the whole thing. He went off rambling about “themes and character development”. He also kept going on about “time travel” and ”comic-book canon”. You know what I think about it? It’s pretty lame and it’s complex, I can’t be bothered to think much. Who even thinks about such stuff anyway… I’m just watching it for the cool effects and funny lines :P

	    It’s such a pity that Patrick missed this outing though. He really would have enjoyed the movie and hanging out with us. He usually is not one to miss outings and all. We should look out in case he’s having any issues. Oh well, maybe next time then.

His results weren’t as good as he had expected but, being the tough bean that he is, wasn’t too distraught. He did mention the many changes we had to adapt to and accepted that a drop in grades was to be expected. 
        <br /><br />
	    Hilman scored the usual. Straight ‘A’s again. I don’t know how that man keeps doing it! Meanwhile here I am proud of my slight improvement from the midyear exams. 
        <br /><br />
        Weirdly, Patrick seemed to have slipped up this time around. Considering that he didn’t want to tell the truth, it must be a sensitive topic for him. I’m just glad that he still managed to find the courage to tell the truth to Adi and Hilman and that they earnestly supported him. I’m really blessed to have such a great group of friends ;)

        The parent-teacher meeting was today. Which means half-day school and more fun soccer times with the bois! What’s more, it seems like my teachers actually said pleasant things about me for once! My parents actually praised me after their meeting with Mdm Chong.

        On a more serious note, Patrick had to follow his parents for the meeting. Most likely because of the sudden dip in his results. He looked so unlike himself today. Just quiet and sullen.

        Almost like clockwork, the 2am message from Patrick came in once again. This time, I decided to set my foot down. Although I do care for Patrick, I still have to take care of myself before I can think about taking care of others. I had 3 papers today and the lack of sleep would not have helped. 
        <br /><br />
        Besides, if I keep responding every time, I’m worried that Patrick may build some form of reliance on me for support and that is definitely not very healthy. That being said, I’ll be sure to let Patrick know that I still care for him and am willing to help him when I can. This would have been easier if Adi and Hilman were here to support Patrick as well.
